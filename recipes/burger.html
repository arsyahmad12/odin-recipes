        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            A very healthy AND flavorful burger with a little extra crunch. Enjoy the end of summer with a burger with kick with The Best Burger In The World, my own creation. Excellent with grilled portobello caps! Note: this is a flammable burger due to the grease. It requires constant attention when grilling due to flare-ups.
