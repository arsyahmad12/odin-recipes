As of now, I'm trying to put into this all I've learned in this brief HTML Course.
Wish me Luck Future me.

After completeing the project, there are a few things I've learned. I've understood how to make a
simple boilerplate, and also how to make headings and paragraphs. I also now know how to insert an
image with an alternative text. Lastly, I know how to make both ordered and unordered list.
